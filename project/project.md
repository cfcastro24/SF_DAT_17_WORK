##Project Options 

**Option 1**
I have a friend that has a company that does tire rethreading in Colombia. The Company sells tires and rethreading of tires and are looking to change their business model from selling goods to selling services. (i.e customer will pay for miles driven instead of on a unit (tire) basis. 

Initial questions for ds project.
What are the factors that contribute to a tire being rejected for rethreading? 
What are the weights of those factors?

Dataset - Tire rethreading operation for the past 10 years. 

**Option 2**
*Sentiment analysis on social media data to predict the outcome of mayor elections in Bogota. 

**Other options**
Something w/ geo location and maps (still need to think more through this)
Build a recommendation engine for something (really like this concept but need to work on ideas)
